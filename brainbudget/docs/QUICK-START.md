cp architecture-diagrams.md docs/
cp database-schema.md docs/
cp user-flows.md docs/
cp microservices-proposal.md docs/
cp learning-roadmap.md docs/
```

### Day 3: Docker Setup

Create `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: expense_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: expense_pass
      POSTGRES_DB: expense_tracker
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data

  # Add more services as needed

volumes:
  postgres_data:
  redis_data:
```

Start services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Day 4-5: Initial Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to web app
cd apps/web

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install additional packages
npm install @tanstack/react-query zustand react-hook-form zod
npm install -D @types/node @types/react
```

Create basic pages:
- Landing page
- Login/Register pages
- Dashboard (empty)

### Day 6-7: Backend Scaffold

```bash

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering early**
   - Start simple, add complexity later
   - Don't build everything at once

2. **Skipping tests**
   - Write tests from day one
   - It saves time in the long run

3. **Not committing regularly**
   - Commit daily
   - Push to GitHub
   - Document progress

4. **Perfectionism**
   - Done is better than perfect
   - You can always refactor

5. **Working in isolation**
   - Share your progress
   - Ask for feedback
   - Engage with community

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Time-box tasks**
   - Don't spend more than planned time
   - Move on, come back later

2. **Take breaks**
   - Use Pomodoro (25 min work, 5 min break)
   - Step away when stuck

3. **Document as you go**
   - Add comments
   - Update README
   - Write ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

4. **Celebrate wins**
   - Each feature is progress
   - Share milestones
   - Be proud of your work

5. **Stay consistent**
   - Code daily, even if just 30 minutes
   - Consistency > intensity
