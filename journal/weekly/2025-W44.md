# Week 44 - 2025 (Oct 28 - Nov 3)

**Theme**: Project Initialization & Workspace Setup

---

## Summary

Started the BrainBudget project from scratch. Focused on setting up a professional development environment with Nx monorepo, establishing best practices for branching strategy, and creating comprehensive documentation structure. Successfully created all core applications and shared libraries using cutting-edge technologies.

**Status**: ✅ Foundation Complete

---

## Accomplished

### Infrastructure & Setup
- ✅ Initialized Git repository with proper remote configuration
- ✅ Set up Nx monorepo workspace with pnpm
- ✅ Installed and configured Nx plugins (Next.js, NestJS, React, Node)
- ✅ Created comprehensive folder structure

### Applications Created
- ✅ `web` - Next.js 16 frontend application (React 19, Turbopack)
- ✅ `web-e2e` - Playwright E2E tests for web app
- ✅ `api` - NestJS backend API
- ✅ `api-e2e` - E2E tests for API

### Shared Libraries Created
- ✅ `ui` - React component library with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ `database` - Database schemas and Prisma configuration (pending setup)
- ✅ `types` - Shared TypeScript type definitions
- ✅ `validation` - Zod validation schemas (pending configuration)
- ✅ `utils` - Shared utility functions

### Documentation
- ✅ Updated README.md with project overview
- ✅ Created BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md with Git workflow
- ✅ Created SETUP.md for development environment
- ✅ Established ADR (Architecture Decision Records) structure
- ✅ Documented first 3 ADRs (Nx, Next.js 16, Tailwind)
- ✅ Created journal structure for progress tracking

### Process & Workflow
- ✅ Established branching strategy (main/develop/feature/*)
- ✅ Defined commit message conventions (Conventional Commits)
- ✅ Set up PR templates and guidelines
- ✅ Planned Notion integration for task management

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Vite ESM Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: UI library with Vite bundler had ESM import error
```
require() of ES Module not supported
```

**Solution**: Renamed `vite.config.ts` to `vite.config.mts` to use ES modules format
```bash
mv ui/vite.config.ts ui/vite.config.mts
```

**Learning**: Vite 7+ requires ES module format for config files when using imports

### Challenge 2: Next.js Version Selection
**Problem**: Uncertainty about using Next.js 16 (very recent release)

**Decision**: Chose Next.js 16 despite being bleeding edge because:
- Turbopack is now stable (2-5× faster builds)
- React 19 is stable
- Starting fresh with no legacy code to migrate
- Demonstrates knowledge of latest tech

**Trade-off**: Accepted potential early bugs for performance and modern features

### Challenge 3: Monorepo Structure
**Problem**: Nx initially created workspace in subdirectory instead of root

**Solution**: Manually moved all files to repository root and removed nested structure
```bash
mv brainbudget/* ./
mv brainbudget/.* ./
rmdir brainbudget/
```

**Learning**: When using existing directory, be explicit about workspace location

## Key Learnings

### Technical

1. **Next.js 16 Breaking Changes**
   - `params` and `searchParams` are now async (must await)
   - `middleware.ts` deprecated in favor of `proxy.ts`
   - Turbopack is now default (webpack needs explicit flag)
   - Requires Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+

2. **Nx Monorepo Benefits**
   - Intelligent dependency graph
   - Cached builds (local and remote)
   - Affected commands for efficient CI/CD
   - Built-in generators for consistency

3. **Vite Configuration**
   - Must use `.mts` extension for ESM configs
   - Different bundlers for different library types (Vite for React, TSC for utilities)

### Process

1. **Documentation First**
   - Writing documentation before coding clarifies thinking
   - ADRs provide valuable context for future decisions
   - Branching strategy prevents chaos later

2. **Professional Practices**
   - Conventional Commits improve git history readability
   - PR templates ensure consistent code review
   - Weekly journals help track progress and learning

---

## Statistics

- **Total Projects**: 9 (2 apps, 2 E2E suites, 5 libraries)
- **Lines of Documentation**: ~1000+
- **ADRs Created**: 3
- **Commits**: 4
- **Time Invested**: ~4 hours

## Next Week (Week 45)

### Priority Tasks

1. **Configuration**
   - [ ] Set up Prisma in database library
   - [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS across projects
   - [ ] Add shadcn/ui component library
   - [ ] Set up environment variables

2. **Development Environment**
   - [ ] Create docker-compose.yml for PostgreSQL and Redis
   - [ ] Set up database migrations
   - [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier rules
   - [ ] Add pre-commit hooks (Husky)

3. **Notion Integration**
   - [ ] Create task board in Notion
   - [ ] Populate backlog with Phase 0 and Phase 1 tasks
   - [ ] Link tasks to GitHub branches/PRs

4. **First Feature**
   - [ ] Start Phase 0: Authentication scaffolding
   - [ ] Create basic auth pages (login, register)
   - [ ] Set up JWT authentication

### Goals
- Complete all initial configuration
- Have local development environment fully functional
- Start implementing first real feature (authentication)

---

## Reflections

### What Went Well
- Chose modern, cutting-edge tech stack (Next.js 16, React 19)
- Established solid foundation with documentation and processes
- No major blockers or issues
- Good progress in limited time

### What Could Be Improved
- Could have researched Next.js 16 breaking changes before starting
- Should verify Node version compatibility earlier
- Could create Notion board simultaneously with code

### Motivation
Excited about the tech stack and architecture. The project has strong foundations and clear direction. Looking forward to building real features next week.
